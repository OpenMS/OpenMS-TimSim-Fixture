# OpenMS-TimSim-Fixture current state

## Repository

Public repository: `OpenMS/OpenMS-TimSim-Fixture`.

The published smoke baseline is tag `v0.1.0-smoke` at commit `a62b878`. The current
development state implements the replicate-aware multi-run study architecture and
post-processing recovery path.

## Canonical multi-run design

The production design is 25 control + 25 treatment runs, 1,000 frozen true
precursors, 1,000 independent entrapments, a 10,000-peptide TimSim blueprint sampled
from a 20,000-peptide synthetic FASTA, and eight transitions per precursor.

Targets are frozen from a blueprint simulation before treatment effects or
replicate-specific abundance are generated. Treatment design defaults to 15%
up-regulated proteins, 15% down-regulated proteins, heterogeneous |log2FC| between
0.5 and 2.0, and independent run-, protein-, and peptide-level abundance variation.

Three quantitative truth layers are explicit:

1. `OpenSwathTimSim.study_design_truth.tsv`: declared population-level protein effects.
2. `OpenSwathTimSim.study_abundance_truth.tsv`: actual per-run TimSim input abundance.
3. `OpenSwathTimSim.realized_truth.tsv`: post-simulation target/run precursor truth.

The target-only OpenDIA lane is authoritative for identification and quantification.
The target+independent-entrapment lane is authoritative for external-null FDR/FDP and
PEP calibration.

## 3+3 full-library validation — completed

Generation completed successfully with 3 control + 3 treatment runs, 1,000 targets,
and 1,000 independent entrapments.

- six TimSim DIA-PASEF runs completed;
- each run contains 8,363 peptides and 12,614 precursor ions;
- 1,000 frozen targets and 6,000 target/run realized-truth rows;
- RT/mz/IM identities are unchanged across all six runs;
- abundance differs for >8,300 of 8,363 peptides in every non-reference run.

OpenDIA target-only lane:

- 1,000/1,000 target precursors recovered in every run at q <= 0.01;
- 6,000/6,000 target/run observations recovered;
- per-run RT MAE 0.76–0.81 s;
- per-run IM MAE approximately 0.00185–0.00189;
- target-only OpenDIA runtime approximately 68 s wall and 1.1 GB peak memory.

Quantitative truth decomposition:

- peptide design vs realized: Pearson r=0.9796, MAE=0.1138;
- protein design vs realized: Pearson r=0.9807, MAE=0.1116;
- peptide realized vs OpenDIA: Pearson r=0.7957, MAE=0.1776, RMSE=0.4658;
- protein realized vs OpenDIA: Pearson r=0.7837, MAE=0.2096, RMSE=0.4745.

The high design-vs-realized correlations validate the study perturbation model. The
larger realized-vs-OpenDIA RMSE relative to MAE and individual examples with >1 log2
unit error indicate a heavy-tail quantification component that must be diagnosed
before the 25+25 production generation.

Differential abundance at 3+3 using BH q <= 0.05 and |log2FC| >= 0.5:

- peptide sensitivity 0.656, precision 0.888, false-positive rate 0.0339;
- protein sensitivity 0.618, precision 0.840, false-positive rate 0.0458.

This 3+3 differential sensitivity is not the production power target; the main purpose
of this stage is architecture, truth, measurement, and calibration validation.

## Independent-entrapment calibration — validated

At nominal q <= 0.01:

- run-level: TP=5,949, entrapment FP=48, empirical FDP=0.0080, recall=0.9915;
- global peptide: TP=995, entrapment FP=12, empirical FDP=0.0119, recall=0.9950;
- final OpenDIA export: TP=5,953, entrapment FP=8, empirical FDP=0.00134;
- unique exported precursor identities: 995 true + 2 entrapments, FDP=0.00201.

Discrimination/calibration:

- run-level ROC AUC 0.9982;
- global-peptide ROC AUC 0.9986;
- entrapment-vs-generated-decoy KS statistic 0.0667;
- run-level PEP Brier 0.0076 / ECE 0.0087;
- global-peptide PEP Brier 0.0099 / ECE 0.0107.

The independent external-null construction is therefore behaving close to the nominal
1% scale in the 1,000-target/1,000-entrapment validation and remains the canonical FDR
lane. The paired-hard construction remains an interference stress test only.

## Quantification diagnostic gate — current next step

Before generating 25+25 runs, run the cheap diagnostic pass on the existing target-only
3+3 benchmark outputs. `tools/diagnose_study_quantification.py` reports:

- per-run log2 TimSim-input vs OpenDIA-intensity correlation and regression slope;
- realized-vs-observed effect slope/intercept;
- metrics after excluding the worst 1% effect residuals;
- p90/p95/p99 residual tails and counts above 0.5/1.0 log2 units;
- association of large effect residuals with RT error, IM error, and realized signal;
- protein effect accuracy stratified by one, two, or >=3 selected precursors;
- ranked peptide/protein quantification outliers.

`benchmark_study_lanes.sh` runs this diagnostic automatically. The next decision is:
if per-run abundance tracking and trimmed effect recovery are strong and errors are
confined to a small heavy tail, proceed to 25+25; if effect slopes are systematically
biased or errors remain broad after trimming, investigate OpenDIA quantification before
scaling.
